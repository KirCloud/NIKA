MAKE SURE TO EDIT YOUR CONFIG (Nika.ini)

Forked by Gerosity.

All that I have added is an easier way to test/change skin id's for the skin changer. Check Nika.ini for this.

I have modified:
Random.hpp, lines 187 - 223
ConfigLoader.hpp, lines 43 - 80 and lines 111 - 148
Nika.ini, lines 42 - 82

By no means am I good at coding.
I did this for quality of life and for fun
